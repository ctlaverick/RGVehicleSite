  "What is a subscription vehicle?":
    "A subscription vehicle is a service that allows you to access a car through a flexible monthly plan. Instead of owning or leasing, you pay a recurring fee that typically includes the vehicle, insurance, maintenance, and roadside assistance.",

  "How does a subscription vehicle Work?":
    "It works like a car-as-a-service model. You choose a vehicle from the available selection, subscribe for a period that fits your needs, and everything from insurance to servicing is taken care of. You can swap vehicles, pause, or cancel based on your plan terms.",

  "How long can I have a subscription vehicle":
    "Subscription durations are flexible. You can subscribe for as little as a month or keep the same vehicle for as long as you like, depending on the plan you choose. Some plans offer discounts for longer-term commitments.",

  "How do you pay for a subscription vehicle":
    "Payment is made through a secure online portal using a credit or debit card. Billing is done monthly, and you'll receive a clear breakdown of what’s included in your subscription.",

  "Do i have to get insurance for the subscription vehicle":
    "No. Insurance is typically included in the subscription fee, so you’re covered for most common situations. We handle the policy, but you should always check the coverage details and any deductible that may apply.",

  "How often can I upgrade to a newer model":
    "You can upgrade as often as your plan allows. Some premium plans let you change vehicles every month, while others may offer upgrades every few months or upon renewal.",

  "Can I have multiple subscription vehicles":
    "Yes, you can have more than one vehicle under subscription, provided your account is in good standing. Each vehicle will have its own monthly fee, and you may need to meet certain criteria for multiple subscriptions."
